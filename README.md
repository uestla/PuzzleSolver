# Puzzle Solver

Solvers for various sudoku-like puzzles written in Java.

All implementations use backtracking algorithm.

All examples are taken from the book [The Mammoth Book of Logical Brain Games](https://bookscouter.com/book/9780762459841) by Gareth Moore which inspired me to create this library.
